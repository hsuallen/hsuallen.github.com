The main reason we moved to Canada was the education in Taiwan, it is way too much for a student to handle.\r\n\r\n### Moving to Canada\r\nIt took the immigrant agency about four years until they came out with a result, after we received the result, we packed up right away and moved here. It was not easy at the beginning, since I did not know a lot of English. But I eventually became really good at speaking it, and everything start to go well in high school.","google":""}
