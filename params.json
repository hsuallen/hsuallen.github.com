The main reason we moved to Canada was the education in Taiwan, it is way too much for a student to handle.\r\n\r\n### Moving to Canada\r\nIt took the immigrant agency about four years until they came out with a result, after we received the result, we packed up right away and moved here. It was not easy at the beginning, since I did not know a lot of English. But I eventually became really good at speaking it, and everything started to go really well in high school.\r\n\r\n### Things I like:\r\n* Text editor Vim with the Solarized colour scheme\r\n* Programming in the language C\r\n* Professional typesetting program called LaTeX\r\n* Massive Multiplayer game League of Legends\r\n* Age of Empires II: the Conquerors\r\n\r\n### Present\r\nLately I have been working on my programming skills in Objective-C, object oriented programming, and iOS Apps development.\r\n\r\n### Future\r\nI am planning on going to Queen's University for either commerce or enginnering. Or Waterloo University for software engineering.\r\n\r\n### Extras\r\n#### Contact Info\r\nEmail: hsu.y.allen@gmail.com\r\n\r\nOther info coming soon!","google":""}
