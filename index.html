        <h3>Welcome to Allen Hsu's home page!</h3>

<p>This website contains personal information about Allen Hsu, and other information.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I am a Canadian student who immigrated from Taiwan, a small island beside China. The main reason we moved to Canada was the education in Taiwan, it is way too much for a student to handle.</p>

<h3>Moving to Canada</h3>

<p>It took the immigrant agency about four years until they came out with a result, after we received the result, we packed up right away and moved here. It was not easy at the beginning, since I did not know a lot of English. But I eventually became really good at speaking it, and everything start to go well in high school.</p>
