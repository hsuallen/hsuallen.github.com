        <h3>Welcome to Allen Hsu's home page!</h3>

<p>This website contains personal information about Allen Hsu, and other information.</p>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>I am a Canadian student who immigrated from Taiwan, a small island beside China. The main reason we moved to Canada was the education in Taiwan, it is way too much for a student to handle.</p>

<h3>Moving to Canada</h3>

<p>It took the immigrant agency about four years until they came out with a result, after we received the result, we packed up right away and moved here. It was not easy at the beginning, since I did not know a lot of English. But I eventually became really good at speaking it, and everything started to go really well in high school.</p>

<h3>Things I like:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Text editor Vim with the Solarized colour scheme</li>
<li>Programming in the language C</li>
<li>Professional typesetting program called LaTeX</li>
<li>Massive Multiplayer game League of Legends</li>
<li>Age of Empires II: the Conquerors</li>
</ul><h3>Present</h3>

<p>Lately I have been working on my programming skills in Objective-C, object oriented programming, and iOS Apps development.</p>

<h3>Future</h3>

<p>I am planning on going to Queen's University for either commerce or enginnering. Or Waterloo University for software engineering.</p>
